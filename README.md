# Dataset

The  project  uses  three  datasets  for  trash  image  classification.  The  first  dataset  consists  of  over  10,000 images  of  organic  and  inorganic  waste.  This  dataset  was  obtained  from  the  Kaggle  website  at [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/techsash/waste-classification-data).
The  second  dataset  consists  of  7  classes  of  trash,  namely  cardboard,  paper,  plastic,  glass,  e-waste, medical,  and  metal.  This  dataset  was  created  by  collecting  600  images  for  each  class  from  various sources,  including  the  Kaggle  website  at  [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/asdasdasasdas/garbage-classification), [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kaustubh2402/ewaste-dataset), and images found from the internet.
The third dataset consists of 11 classes of trash, namely cardboard, paper, plastic, glass, e-waste, medical, metal,  clothes,  shoes,  hazardous,  and  sanitary.  This  dataset  was  created  by  collecting  between  3000  to 5000   images   for   most   classes   from   various   sources,   including   the   Kaggle   website   at [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/asdasdasasdas/garbage-classification), [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mostafaabla/garbage-classification),the  Roboflow  website  datasets, and images from the internet.
