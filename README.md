# Dataset

Created Own Larger Datasets and saved at [here](https://github.com/Atharva309/trash_classification_data.git).

The  project  uses  three  datasets  for  trash  image  classification.  The  first  dataset  consists  of  over  10,000 images  of  organic  and  inorganic  waste.  This  dataset  was  obtained  from  the  Kaggle  website  at [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/techsash/waste-classification-data).

The  second  dataset  consists  of  7  classes  of  trash,  namely  cardboard,  paper,  plastic,  glass,  e-waste, medical,  and  metal.  This  dataset  was  created  by  collecting  600  images  for  each  class  from  various sources,  including  the  Kaggle  website  at  [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/asdasdasasdas/garbage-classification), [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kaustubh2402/ewaste-dataset), and images found from the internet.

The third dataset consists of 11 classes of trash, namely cardboard, paper, plastic, glass, e-waste, medical, metal,  clothes,  shoes,  hazardous,  and  sanitary.  This  dataset  was  created  by  collecting  between  3000  to 5000   images   for   most   classes   from   various   sources,   including   the   Kaggle   website   at [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/asdasdasasdas/garbage-classification),  [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mostafaabla/garbage-classification), the  Roboflow  website  datasets, and images from the internet.

# Result

We achieved an accuracy of 0.795 for organic/inorganic classification using MobileNet, and an accuracy of 0.877 for the same task using ResNet. For the 7-class  trash  classification  task,  we  achieved  an  accuracy  of  0.912  using  ResNet,  and  an accuracy of 0.87 using YOLOv5 after 100 epochs. Finally, for the 11-class trash classification task, we achieved an accuracy of 0.82 using YOLOv5 after 35 epochs. These results show the effectiveness of our proposed approach and demonstrate the potential of deep learning models in the field of trash image classification. However,further improvements in accuracy and model performance can be achieved by increasing the size and diversity of the dataset, as well as by fine-tuning the hyperparameters of the models.
